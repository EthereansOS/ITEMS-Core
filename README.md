## The Ecosystem of ITEMS on top of ETHEREUM

## CREATE

Create your own Item collections. Set owners (wallets and contracts able to mint Items) for each, and program extensions for every individual Item, making them truly portable.

## WRAP

Wrap any ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 into an Item, empowering it with the qualities of all. Save gas Batch-Swapping ERC20s, farm and use ERC1155s in DeFi dApps, swap ERC721s on Uniswap—a world of possibilities awaits you.

## DeFi NFTs

DeFi lovers can finally swap NFTs and collectibles, farm any object, arbitrage them via DeFi dApps as well as NFT stores, and more—at long last, the NFT and ERC20 ecosystems have been merged into one.
EXPLORE Explore, swap, arbitrage, bid for and track prices of all existing ethItems.

## FARM

Farm and setup farming contracts for your Items, with full DeFi integration.

## BUIDL

Every Item is built with extendible contracts; you can undergird them with complex technology. This is the first general-purpose, interoperable and programmable token standard. With ethItem, you can call all existing Items via proxy contracts, without needing to hardcode every address.

## ITEM the Programmable Equity of the ETHITEM DFO

ETHITEM protocol is built on top of a Decentralized Flexible Organization (DFO), ruled 100% on-chain—without the need for any offchain intermediary—by holders of its programmable equity, ARTE.
